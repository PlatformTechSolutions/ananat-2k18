        					<p id="para">Where reality ends, fiction begins. Fiction reveals truth that reality obscures. Artist use lies to tell the truth. They created lies because we believed in it, we found something true about ourself.</p>
        					<p id="para">Fiction is something upon which we go cold-turkey, our mind and consciousness changes. It is anything that makes you believe that occupies your time, that plays with your time and that alters our time.</p>
        					<p id="para">Let's step out of our thoughts and transport ourselves into a make believe abstraction in the 'WORLD OF FICTION' at ANANT TWENTY EIGHTEEN</p></center>
